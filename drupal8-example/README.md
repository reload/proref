# Drupal 8 example setup, with docker.

## Works well with the makeup-example in reload/proref.

## Using NFS with Docker for Mac
- `$ cp docker-compose.override.yml.mac-nfs.dist docker-compose.override.yml`
  
## Theming
This example comes with a NPM docker container, gulp/npm files and an empty,
custom Drupal 8 theme base.
